ipywidgets_bokeh
================

Support for using ipywidgets within [Bokeh](https://bokeh.org). Ipywidgets are normally used in Jupyter notebooks, but this project allows them to be embedded into a Bokeh application so that they can be used alongside and with Bokeh-based plots and Bokeh widgets.  See the separate [jupyter_bokeh](https://github.com/bokeh/jupyter_bokeh) library for support for using Bokeh plots and widgets in Jupyter and ipywidgets (the opposite case from what ipywidgets_bokeh supports).
